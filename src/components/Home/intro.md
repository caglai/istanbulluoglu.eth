### Hello! 

Since very young age, I always wanted to be a scientist. I chose Chemistry as a medium to follow my dreams. 

And I loved it.

In the junior year of the university, I went to Germany with ERASMUS scholarship to work on photovoltaics applications. 
In that experience, I constructed organic solar cells and analyzed their efficiency. During this, I realized that I have a huge interest in 
data science.

When I was doing my Master's, my friend and I implemented an automation tool to calculate the efficiency of solar cells, which made our team's life much easier and saved us a ton of time. This connected me to the CS one more step.

During pandemic, the lab that I was working at as a PhD Candidate was shut down. When we were stuck at home for almost a year,
I had a chance to focus on the data scientist in me. And I started to take online courses. With growing interest and 
love in computer science, I knew I needed to pursue this further. 

Luckly, I got admitted into Computer Science programme at 
Simon Fraser University. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Now I am pursing this new career with my Chemistry background together which has tons of fun!
